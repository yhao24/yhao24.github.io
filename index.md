## About me

I'm a second year PhD student and Teaching Assistant at the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). My current interests are in functional data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and nonparametric statistics.

I received my Bachelor of Economics at Southwest University of Political Science and Law (SWUPL) in the Spring of 2021, and received my Master of Science in Statistics from the MSCS at UIC in the Winter of 2022.
